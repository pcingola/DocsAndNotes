Ref: [Fast.ai: Introduction to random forests](http://course18.fast.ai/lessonsml1/lesson1.html)
- See Jupiter notebook `ml/randomForest/Bulldozers.ipynb`
- Random forest are easy, generic and require no prior assumptions
- To use a random forest you need to convert categorical data to numeric.

- Create a shallow RandomForest model having a single tree: it's a crappy model, but you can draw the tree to gain insight into the data.
- Building a tree:
  - How to build a RandomForest: Just build a bunch of Trees
  - How to build a Tree: For each variable, for each possible splits (middle point betwee in your dataset), pick the 'best' split
  - How to compare 'splits': For each split compare the r^2 of the parent node vs the weighted average of the r^2 of the child nodes
  - In practice: Gini gain is often used
- OOB: Out of bag predictions. Use the samples that were not used by bootstrapping to test the Tree, average for all trees that were not using the sample in order to get the tree ensamble average (note that this leaves some trees out, so the average is worst than a test set)
- Tunning the RandomFores model:
	- `n_estimators`: Suggested values are `{10, 50, 100}`. Increasing the number of trees in the RandomForest reached a plateau at some point. Usualy this is after 100 trees for small datasets
	- `min_samples_leaf`: Suggested values are `{1, 3, 10, 100}`. By default RandomForest stops building the tree when every sample is a leaf node. Use `min_samples_leaf > 1` to stop earlier (you want generalization, going all the way down will overfit the tree).
	- `max_features`: Suggested values are `{0.5, 'srqt', 'log2'}`. To create uncorrelated trees, you can randomly limit the number of parameters (i.e. columns in your data frame):e.g. `max_features=0.5` other good options are `'sqrt', 'log2'`

- Calculate the variance of the estimators (i.e. all trees) to have an estimate of the "confidence" the model has in the predicted value.
