# ML & AI: Notes & Learning points

Some learning points about ML & AI.
These are in no particular order


# General ML

- Course of dimentionality is not a real concern in practice for many ML problems
- The "No free lunch" theorem doesn't usually apply in practice because practical ML problems are not totally random data (i.e. the data lies within a sub-manifold)
- `r^2 = 1-SS_reg / SS_tot`, the second term is the ratio between `SS_reg` (sum of squared errors of our model) and `SS_tot` (sum of squared error of a very naive estimator, that is the just the mean). This is a number below 1.0, it can be negative infinity (not between 0 and 1 as many people think)
- Build 5 basic models (one better than the other), test them on the test and validation set. The scores should be in the same direcction, otherwise the test/validation models are biased.
- For exploring / finding models you probably don't need millions of datapoints. Subsample to a point when you can get the models to train within a few minutes/seconds so you can iterate faster.

# Data pre-processing

- Try sorting accordingly if the categorical data has an ordering, e.g. `['low' 'medium' 'high']` it sometimes provides a small advantage (by default most packages just sort alphabetically)
- Expand 'data/timestamp' into many columns (`year, month, day, day_of_weeK, is_holliday`, etc.)
- Saving the data in `feather` format is udualy fast (the dataFrame is just dumped from memory to disk, so it's fast)
- Dividing 80% training, 10% testing and 10% validation works usualy OK, but if you have millions of samples, you might only need 1% for test and validation (or even 0.1%)
- Add a column for missing data: e.g. if your column is called `value`
    - Create a new column `value_na` which is `{0, 1}` depending on whether the value is missing or not
    - Fill missing values in `value` by setting them to the mean / median / default
- Do basic statistics: mean, stdev, max, min, number of missing values, distribution, etc.
- If you are interested on money amounts, it might be better to use the `log`
- Perform a "one hot encoding" for categorical input variables, most machine learning models need this, An exception can be categories with high cardinality (i.e. too many options).

# Exploratory data analaysis

- Calculate ranking variables having missing values
- Create a shallow RandomForest model having a single tree: it's a crappy model, but you can draw the tree to gain insight into the data.
- For large datasets, there is no point on always using all the samples to train the model during the explaratory analysis: Just sub-sample your dataset
- Perform a "feature impoirtance analysis" (see "Randome forest" for details).
- Perform hierarchical clustering (use spearman's rank-order correlation `pearmanr`)

# Ensemble models
- Bagging: Create many models that are somewhat predictive, but have un-correlated errors. When you average all the models, you have `mean(prediction_i + error_i) = mean(prediction_i) + mean(error_i)`. The second term tends to zero (errors are uncorrelated with mean 0), so we have a much better predition.
- Bag if little bootstraps: It is more important to be uncorrelated than predictive (e.g. Extremelly randomized trees)
- Calculate the variance of the estimators to have an estimate of the "confidence" the ensembl model has in the predicted value.
