## Lymphatic system

The Lymphatic system’s has a major role fighting infections.

- Lymph: Fluid 
- Lymph nodes (~700 to 800): Checkpoints, monitor and clears lymph as it filters through
They clean roughly 3 liters of blood per day (of the total 6L in the blood)
Enlarged Lymph nodes usually mean infection
- Lymphatic organs:
	- Spleen: Provides nurturing for Lymphocytes
	- Thymus: Provides nurturing for Lymphocytes
	- Adenoids:
	- Tonsils (Amigdalas)
- Lymphatic capillaries: Converge to Lymphatic Ducts
- Lymphatic Ducts

# Immune system

Multiple components
1. Innate immune system
1. Adaptive immune system
1. Cellular immune response

# 1. Innate immune system

Innate (a.k.a. non-specific) immune system
- External barricades:
	- Skin
	- Defensins (host defense peptides): They consist of 18-45 amino acids including six (in vertebrates) to eight conserved cysteine residues. Cells of the immune system contain these peptides to assist in killing phagocytosed bacteria
	- Mucous membranes
- Internal defences
		- Antimicrobial proteins
		- Attack cells
		- Fever: Increase temper
		- Inflammation: An internal “fire alarm”
			- Histamine triggers vasodilation (redness, increased temperature, swelling, attracts phagocytes).
			- Anti-Histamines: You take them when there is an “Allergic reaction”, these suppress Histamines if it’s triggering an unwanted immune reaction.
- Cell defenses
	- Leukocytes: White blood cells. They can access any part of the body, except the central nervous system and the spinal cord.
	- Phagocytes (a type of Leukocyte):
		- Neutrophils: The most abundant white cells. They die after ingesting a pathogen (pus is made of these cells).
		- Macrophages: Derived from Monocyte white blood cells that moved out of the blood stream to occupy tissue. Can engulf and destroy many pathogens (as opposed to Neutrophils, that can only do it once)
			- Fixed: Attache to fibers in specific organs
			- Free: Patrol tissue
	- Natural Killer Cells (NKC, a subtype of T-Lymphocytes): 
		- Patrol blood and Lymphs looking for abnormal cells
		- Can kill human cells, if they are infected or become cancerous
		- Healthy / Normal cells express MHC-1 (Major Histocompatibility Complex)
		- If a cell is infected, it does not express MHC-1
		- If NKC detects an infected cell, it pokes holes with enzymes that trigger apoptosis (it does not phagocyte the cell).

# 2. Adaptive immune system

Adaptive (a.k.a. specific or acquired) immune system: “Learns and keeps a memory of the infections”
It has to know the pathogen and recognize it before attacking.
We are not born with a working immune.
Two cooperating systems
- Humoral immunity / humoral response: The pathogens are in the fluids
- Cellular defences / cell infected response / cell immune response: The pathogens invaded cells

All animals have innate immune system, even sponges, but only vertebrates have acquired immune system.

# Antibodies

Antiboduies, a.k.a. Immunoglobulins / Ig, plasma-soluble B-cell receptors.

References: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3LXXq05eko

Antibodies serve as a “tag” to alert Phagocytes to eat the Antigen they attach to.
Blood protein produced in response to and counteracting a specific antigen. Antibodies combine chemically with substances which the body recognizes as alien, such as bacteria, viruses, and foreign substances in the blood.

- Are “the reason why vaccination works”.
- Made by special white blood cells
- They patrol the “Humoral system” (blood and lymph)

How they defend from invasion:
- They can physically block the binding sites on viruses or bacteria, so they cannot hook-up to tissues
- They can bind to multiple antigens at the same time, producing Agglutination, meaning that the antigens cannot move easily
- They “call” phagocytes and special lymphocytes to eat the patogen

Antibodies consist of a Y-shaped structure formed by 4 polypeptide subunits bound together by bisulfate bonds (covalent bonds): 2 heavy chains and 2 light chains. The heavy chains form the “constant” regions, that binds to the cell surface. The “variable” regions holds different sequences of amino acids that can bind to specific antigens.

The variable regions contain “antigen binding sites”. The region of the antigen that binds to the antigen-binding site is called “antigenic-determinant” or “epitope” .

There are 5 types of Antibodies (determined by the “constant” region of the antibody):
1. IgG: The most common type (75% of the antibodies are IgG). In blood and lymph.
1. IgM: Found on B-lymphocytes’ membranes
1. IgE: Involved in “allergic reactions”
1. IgD: Found on B-lymphocytes, help differentiate B-cells into “Plasma Cells”
1. IgA: Primary found in digestive and respiratory tracts.

# B-Lymphocyte

Originates and matures in the bone marrow, where they develop:
- Immunocompetence: how to recognize a particular antigen.
- Cell tolerance: How not to attack our own cells

Once matured, they display up to 10,000 membrane-bound antibodies on their surface. Each B-Lymphocyte has a unique set of antibodies. All B-Lymphocytes together can hold 2,000,000 different antibodies.
If a B-Lymphocyte finds an antigen it has antibodies for, it “recognizes” it and binds to it. This “activates” the B-Cell, which starts reproducing like crazy and specialize in two categories:
1. Effector cell / Plasma cells / Plasmacytes: Most become “Effector cells” (active fighters)
	1. Have large amounts of endoplasmic reticulum
	1. Can mass-produce the same antibodies for the particular invader (2,000 antibodies per second for five days, until they die).
1. Memory cells: A few become long term “Memory cells” that keep the antibody (genetic) code in case it’s seen again. If the antigen returns, the body has a prepared immune response (stronger and faster).

B-cell receptors bind to and antigen (e.g. the antigen is either floating around in our blood or “presented” by a macrophage using an MHC-II), then the antigen is engulfed by the B-cell (cell-mediated endocytosis). Once inside the B-cell, lysosomes break down the antigen. A small portion of the antigen,  known as the “antigenic determinant” or “epitope”, is taken and place on MHC-II and exposed (“presented”) on the surface of the B-Cell.
For any defense mechanism to start, the B-cell must interact with a Helper T-cell having a matching (complementary ) antibody as well as CD4 glycoprotein. The Helper T-cell releases Lymphokines which trigger cloning and differentiation in the B-cell. Some of the cloned B-cell differentiate into “Plasma cells”, which produce “plasma soluble B-Cell receptors” (i.e. antibodies).

# 2.2 Cellular immune response

This defense system kicks in when the previous two systems have been breached and the pathogen is inside the cell.

Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC, a.k.a. HLA):

Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDAGxVxY-L8

Some cells in the immune system go around wearing parts of the organisms they defeated so others can see them. They break pathogens into molecules and “displays” the bits in “grooved proteins” (MHC) on the membrane. Cells that do this are called “Professional Presenting Antigen Cells” (they express MHC-2). Are there “Amateur presenting”? Yes, the “regular” cells which express MHC-1

MHC-1
All nucleated cells (all cells except red blood cells) presents have Class-1 MHC. MHC-1 presents short chains of amino-acids that based on endogenous proteins (proteins synthesized inside the cell).
If the cell is normal / healthy it expresses MCH-1 displaying normal amino acid chains (“self-antigen”, which means an “antigen” from proteins within the cell). The immune cells recognize them as OK.
If the cell is infected or cancerous, it “presents” parts of the proteins from the patogen (antigens) which get “presented” by MHC-1 to the surface, signalling the immune system that there is a problem, so the leukocytes bind and react by trigger apoptosis of the affected cell.

MHC-1 complex is formed by 4 polypeptide units: alpha-1, alpha-2, alpha-3 (connected to the surface of the cell) and beta-2. Alpha-3 is connected to the cell membrane.

MHC-2
MHC-2 is used to “communicate” between lymphocytes.
MHC-2 is found on specific Leukocytes (Macrophages, Dendritic cells, B-cells, and certain T-cells) express MHC-2. Also composed of 4 subunits: alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2. 

When a Macrophage engulfs a bacteria, is breaks down the bacterial cells. Some of the pathogenic proteins are now within the macrophage and uses MHC-2 to expose some of these exogenous fragments (antigens), these fragments are not produced by our body (i.e. they are fragment of a virus/bacteria that was engulfed). Now the MHC-2-antigen complex, is on the macrophage surface, it releases IL-1 (interleukin 1) that recruits Helper T-cells.
Once the T-cell is bound to the macrophage, releases IL-2 (Interleukin 2) that tells B-cells and T-cells to differentiate:
B-lymphocytes differentiate into
Memory B cells
Plasma T-cells: Produce antibodies that are complementary to the ones in the MHC-2 from the Macrophage. 
T-lymphocytes differentiate into 
Memory T cells
Cytotoxic T-cells: The differentiated cytotoxic cell has the specific antibody that binds to the antigen from the patogen, thus able to recognize the bacterial cells, releasing proteins that drill holes in the pathogen.

MHC-3
THere is an MHC-3 (no idea what it does).

MHC vs HLA
MHC in humans is also known as Human Leukocytes Antigen (HLA).

T-Lymphocytes (T-Cells)

T-cells / T-Lymphocytes are at the code of the adaptive immune response.
T-cells are made in the bone marrow, but mature in the Thymus (thus the “T” in the name).
Several types of T-cells:
Helper (CD4+): They cannot kill, but they activate cells that do it. A “naive” helper T-cell has receptors that only bind to one particular MHC-2 and antigen combination. When it binds, the cell is activated, it makes many copies with this particular antibody (similar to B-cell activation):
Some are helper T-cells
Some are memory T-cells (remember this antibody for the future)
Many are effector T-cells:
Regulatory T-cells: Release inhibiting cytokines once the threat has been handled (without this there would be continuous hyper activated immune system).
Activated Helper T-cells create Cytokines. Cytokines make helper T-cells to divide, creating some sort of “positive reinforcement loop”.
Cytotoxic (CD8+): They do the killing. Activated by cytokines. When the MHC-2 finds an infected cell with the proper MHC-1, it binds and releases enzymes that “punch holes” in the infected cell (Granzymes and Perforins), thus killing the cell (Apoptosis).
Memory
Suppressor
Natural Killer Cell

T-cells cannot detect whole antigens, they just recognize the “bits” displayed by MHC-2

Cytokines: They are expressed by activated T-cells and help to propagate the signal to other T-cells. Cytokines also “finish the training” of B-cells.
Antibody receptors in B-cells are generated randomly
B-cells could bind to healthy proteins. B-cells engulf the protein and present it on the surface. Then they “stop” for inspection (from a T-cell).
If the T-cell binds to the presented protein, it releases cytokines which activate the B-cell
If it doesn’t, the B-cell just goes inactivated, not triggering any immune response).

T-cells can 
Cause inflamation
Activate macrophages
Get other T-Cells fired up
Regulate immune response


The antigen presenting kills a pathogen and presents the antigen (parts of the killed pathogen) on the surface, then the cell produces Interleukin-1 (“hey, look what I killed”), the helper T-cell produces Interleukin-2 (“alarm, there is an invader pathogen”). The helper T-cell is activated and starts making copy.

T-Cell receptors:
Similar to B-cells, T-cells have a special receptors. We categorize T-cells according to their receptors:
Alpha-Beta T cells: They have T-cell receptors having Alpha-Beta subunits
Gamma-Delta T-cells: They have T-cell receptors having Gamma-Delta subunits

Antigen Presenting Cells (APC) “present” antibodies, i.e. they show antibodies on their surfaces using MHC-II proteins (a.k.a. HLA). Alpha-Beta T-Cells bind to MHCs from APCs.
There are two Glycoproteins necessary for binding: CD4 and CD8. The difference between CD4 and CD8 is that they bind to different types of MHCs. Cells with CD4 can only bind to MHC-II, CD8 can only bind to MHC-I.

If the CD4 cell binds to a B-cell, it triggers mitosis (cloning) and differentiation to Plasma cells and Memory B-cells
If the CD4 cell binds to a Macrophages or Dendritic cells, it releases lymphokines which stimulates cell-mediated immunity (bring more cells to attack the pathogens).

In case of CD8 cells (Cytotoxic T-cells / Killer T-cell), it binds to MHC-I, thus helping to kill infected cell.



# Nomenclature

- Antigen: Antigens comes from “Antibody Generator”. An invader bacteria, virus, fungus, toxin or a deceased cell. Most of the time “antigens” are large molecules not found in the body.

- Antibodies: a.k.a. Immunoglobulins / Ig, plasma-soluble B-cell receptors

- Pathogen: Something bad that wants to invade your body: bacteria, virus, fungus, etc.
